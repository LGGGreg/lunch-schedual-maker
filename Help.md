This program keeps a list of students in a file called "Data.txt"
Feel free to open this file (it is in the same folder as this program) and edit it how you like.

When you press the "Generate Lunch Plan" button, it will read that file, pick out some table leads, and show you the lunch schedual.  This output is automatically saved in a file named "Lunch.txt" with a number at the end.

The program will then record who has been a table lead in the "Data.txt" file so it does not choose them the next times you press the Generate button.

To print the output, open up the text file the generate button makes in any program, and use it to print.  You may see files like "Lunch1.txt" "Lunch2.txt", the higher the number, the newer the list.

It is advised to only press the generate button once a week, instead of making all of the 'Lunch" lists at once, because then if a kid leaves or joins, you can edit the "Data.txt" file and get them right in line.   Other than this, there is no harm in creating a whole years worth of scheduals (just by clicking the "Generate" button allot of times)

If this program gives you an error when you try to run it, you will need to download and install this program.
