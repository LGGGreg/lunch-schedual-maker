This program takes a list of Kids (in the file Data.txt) and generates a lunch schedual that randomly rotates their seating and the table lead.  It also helps make sure each kid gets a chance to be the table lead. 

This program comes from a request
"I would like for you to make a chart for when we go to the lunch room.....there will be six people to a table and each week we like to mix them up and i would like for you to do it for us via computer - understand ALSO there should be one captian to each table and hopefully that changes each week so that each kid will get the chance to be one."

The Data.txt file should be formatted with one Kid per line, and information on whether they have or have not yet been a table lead.
Example:
Person 1 hasn't been a table lead.
Person 2 hasn't been a table lead.
Person 3 hasn't been a table lead.

Data.txt is updated at the program runs, and the lunch schedual is saved to a txt file, pressing the generation button multiple times will generate additional weeks scheduals based on the previous ones (who has been a leader, etc)
