I would like for you to make a chart for when we go to the lunch room.....there will be six people to a table and each week we like to mix them up and i would like for you to do it for us via computer - understand     ALSO there should be one captian to each table and hopefully that changes each week so that each kid will get the chance to be one.  CALL ME IF YOU NEED FOR INFORMATION

LET ME KNOW IF YOU GET THIS  --- T H A  N K    Y O U !!
